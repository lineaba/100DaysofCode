# 100DaysofCode
Tracking my own progress as I go through #100DaysofCode

Weekly report
WEEK 1
Sunday march 25th:
First day out of 100. I have been busy all day, doing errands in the morning, and hanging out with my parent in the afternoon, and I almost postponed getting started untill tomorrow, but luckily I participated in the CodeNewbie twitterchat this morning while I was getting groceries, and something about having set out loud that I was gonna start today made me feel accountable. So this evening I have been looking at a couple different learning platforms, and decided to do a quick exercise from exercism.io
I wrote the shortest working version of the Bob project that I could. It is no masterpiece, but I have started, and that is really half the battle (finishing is the other half, I guess)
Either way, here we go. 1 down, 99 to come

Check this out:
1) Get familiar with the command line (https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
