Tracking my own progress as I go through #100DaysofCode

Weekly report

WEEK 1

Sunday march 25th:

First day out of 100. I have been busy all day, doing errands in the morning, and hanging out with my parent in the afternoon, and I almost postponed getting started untill tomorrow, but luckily I participated in the CodeNewbie twitterchat this morning while I was getting groceries, and something about having set out loud that I was gonna start today made me feel accountable. So this evening I have been looking at a couple different learning platforms, and decided to do a quick exercise from exercism.io
I wrote the shortest working version of the Bob project that I could. It is no masterpiece, but I have started, and that is really half the battle (finishing is the other half, I guess)
Either way, here we go. 1 down, 99 to come

Monday March 26th:

So many interesting things to do, so hard to choose what to do. Struggling to not do too many things a little bit, but finding a focus and sticking with it. Today I did a little bit of the command line tutorial, but it was focused on Linux environments, and I didn't feel like setting up a virtual machine, so I abandoned it. I solved the leap year problem from exercism.io and got to practice working with try and except - sidenote: I usually like the readability and "Englishness" of Python, but I do feel like the try, catch throw semantics of C++ seems a little more "natural" to me, although the struggle of having to catch the errors, seemed to be simpler in Python. I started the morning out with a couple video lessons from the courses machine learning course, and also finished my evening that way. 
Also, language sidenote: why do we say zero pointS, one point, two points. How come zero items have a plural ending? 

Tuesday, March 27th:

Squeezed in a little bit of code at the end of a long day at warner bros studio, Hollywood and BBQ'ING with parents and Stuart. Worked on the robot_name exercise from exercism.io. Didn't go as fast at smooth as the others, but I'm chalking it up to being super tired. However, maybe I should do some work on learning a bit more pythonian Python, I have a sense that I might be a little to "brute force" dependent at this point. 

Check this out:
1) Get familiar with the command line (https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)

2) Develop add-ons for google docs, Long term goal (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/)
