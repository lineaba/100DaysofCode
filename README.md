# 100DaysofCode
Tracking my progress as I go through #100DaysofCode

Read my log above, or check out the list of ressources I am planning to check out (this is truly just a random collection of things I stumble upon)

Week 2 - currently working on a name generator app, and a progres-o-meter for counting down my 100 days. Also doing challenges on FreeCodeCamp
