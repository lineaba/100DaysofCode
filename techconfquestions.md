# Tech Conf Conversation Starters # 

I have collected these suggestion from a twitter thread where I asked people for good conversation starters during informal times at a tech conference (lunch, break, etc.)

Huge thanks to all who gave their advice on twitter.

_I have paraphrased and categorized the questions. Some questions could've probably gone in more than one of the categories below_
