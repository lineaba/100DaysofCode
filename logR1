This is the log for my #100daysofcode challenge started on Monday April 9th

DAY 1 - Monday april 9th
Went to a python meetup and worked on preparing data for the project I got the idea for that morning. I am creating a LLC name generator
simply its a program that comes up with word combinations of three words, two first words starting with L, and third word starting with C. 
The results are supposed to be bandnames. Even though it is a very simple and silly idea, I believe it will be a very good learning project, 
and one that really encompases my goals of learning more about NLP. I invision the program can help me while I study:
- Data processing / data preparation (Words for generator - tagged for part-of-speech)
- Web development (+deployment)
- Front-end development (which I have very little experience with beyond my love (read: HATE) relationship with TKinter
- Database (I wan't to make people able to judge each generated name, and store that information)
- Supervised Machine Learning (I wan't to train a name-producing machine on the data I will hopefully be storing in a database to eventually be able to generator THE BEST NAME OF ALL TIMES)
SO yeah, that's the plan! 

DAY 2 - Tuesday april 10th
Check in: Gonna do the last little bit of work on my temporary data for the LLC namegenerator, and then tweek my first draft of the name generator
to produce the different word patterns I decided on yesterday. 
IDEA: Se if there is any data from sentiment analysis about the "funnyness" of words, which might be an interesting property to consider in generating names.
Check-out: Ending up spending more time than I first imagined on the data preparation file, that I didn't get to work on the actual name generator.
Created a github repo for the project (lineaba/LLCgenerator), and uploaded the prepare_data code to it, together with the L-words and C-words file. 
Also decided to starts a questions file in this repo, with more general python questions that arise during coding, but that I wouldn't necessarily wanna have to research to answer straight away
I include an example of where the question arose for me in actual code, and mark it with the #$$$[texthere]$$$# in code, so I can refer back to it later.
Reflection: I was giving myself a 30-min timeframe today, and was planning to do some work in preparation for my bachelors tonight, and I was debating whether I should do one or the other(the other being coding) tonight
Ended up deciding to start with 30 mins. of code, and even set a timer, but when first I got started it was very hard to stop again when the timer rang. I will have to keep this in mine when planning my day (and find a balance, cause I am sure the same thing could've happended the other way around,where I got really into bachelor's research and didn't get around to coding before it became to late.

DAY 3 - Wednesday april 11th
Check in:  working in my time on morning commute and before class. Not ideal, but better than not putting in time this morning.
Will work on first draft of name generator to fit the word patterns
Check-out: Did not get a full 30 mins in, but a little is better than none, and I have a very packed schedule today, so I am just happy I got some done
Worked on importing data from the two word-list files to name-generator. Also wrote a first draft for a recursive word-picking function (ensuring that the two l-words will not be the same)
However, I haven't tested it yet, so it might need a lot of reworking. I sense that my thinking about recursive functions have been so influenced by C++ and that I am confusing myself a bit in python, 
because I can't fully conceptualize the passing of data on the fly. I might wanna find a source to brush up on recursion in Python. 
Reflection: I wish there was a way to say "God Arbejdslyst" in English - good luck just doesn't feel like it cuts it. This is niot luck, these are people working hard to achieve a goal!

DAY 4 - Thursday april 12th
Check-in: Unfortunately, I'll have to chop my 30 mins into chunks today. I am planning on adding the word-order patterns to the LLC name generator, and produce output randomly that fits one of the 3 current patterns. 
Check-out: Was able to actually carve out a full 30 mins later in the day, after having done a shorter burst of work earlier in the afternoon. Definately getting more done when I have full 30 min period, so I will try and do what I can to ensure that.
Worked on making the LLC generator able to generate names following 3 word-order-patterns, which is now working, and the names are quite great, honestly. 
While working, I realized that the wordlists didn't contain any adjectives, turns out adjectives are not tagged with "a" in  the dataset, but with "j". Get to know your data-set better, I guess. So had to make small changes to the dataprep program. 
Still need to work on some things, but I have made some progress, which is nice. 
Reflection: Procrastinating on something else is a solid way to force more time onto coding, but probably not the best idea in the long run

DAY 5 - Friday april 13th
Check-in: I am exhausted, have had such a fun day at six flags, but now I am ready to put in my 30 mins, working on writing a better function to shape the progressive form of verbs from my dictionary. 
I actually took a little headstart in the bus, finding some rules to use for the algorhitm, and then starting to write some code. 
(later) check-out: Almost fell asleep while I was coding, but I did manage to write a few lines of code, dealing with some of the progressive rules. Definetely not my most focused work, but I am satisfied that I pushed thorugh and did some, despite how tired I was.

Saturday april 14th
I completely forgot to code saturday. Sunday will be day 6, extending my 100 days by one day

DAY 6 - Sunday april 15th 
Check-in: I have joined an accountability group with other codenewbies Scooter, nabheet, clifton and Marshall. Today I am coding for 1 hour, to get my self strong back into the game. I am continuing to work on the progressive form creation in the LLC generator.
