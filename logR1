This is the log for my #100daysofcode challenge started on Monday April 9th

DAY 1 - Monday april 9th
Went to a python meetup and worked on preparing data for the project I got the idea for that morning. I am creating a LLC name generator
simply its a program that comes up with word combinations of three words, two first words starting with L, and third word starting with C. 
The results are supposed to be bandnames. Even though it is a very simple and silly idea, I believe it will be a very good learning project, 
and one that really encompases my goals of learning more about NLP. I invision the program can help me while I study:
- Data processing / data preparation (Words for generator - tagged for part-of-speech)
- Web development (+deployment)
- Front-end development (which I have very little experience with beyond my love (read: HATE) relationship with TKinter
- Database (I wan't to make people able to judge each generated name, and store that information)
- Supervised Machine Learning (I wan't to train a name-producing machine on the data I will hopefully be storing in a database to eventually be able to generator THE BEST NAME OF ALL TIMES)
SO yeah, that's the plan! 

DAY 2 - Tuesday april 10th
check in: Gonna do the last little bit of work on my temporary data for the LLC namegenerator, and then tweek my first draft of the name generator
to produce the different word patterns I decided on yesterday. 
IDEA: Se if there is any data from sentiment analysis about the "funnyness" of words, which might be an interesting property to consider in generating names.
